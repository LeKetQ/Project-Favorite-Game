            <p><cite>The game takes place in a fictional fantasy world based on Slavic mythology.
                    Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer for hire known as a Witcher,

                    Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters,
                    and complete quests to acquire experience points and gold, which are used to increase Geralt's
                    abilities and purchase equipment. The game's story has three possible endings,
                    determined by the player's choices at key points in the narrative.</cite></p>
