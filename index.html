            <p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action role-playing game developed by Polish developer CD Projekt Red,
                and first published in 2015. It is the sequel to the 2011 game The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and the
                third game in The Witcher video game series, played in an open world with a third-person perspective.

                <p>The games are based on The Witcher series of fantasy novels written by Andrzej Sapkowski.</p>

                <p>The game takes place in a fictional fantasy world based on Slavic mythology. Players control Geralt of
                Rivia, a monster slayer for hire known as a Witcher, and search for his adopted daughter, who is on the
                run from the otherworldly Wild Hunt. Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic,
                interact with non-player characters, and complete quests to acquire experience points and gold, which
                are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment. The game's story has three possible
                endings, determined by the player's choices at key points in the narrative.</p>
